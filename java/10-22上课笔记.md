- `clone`的步骤

  1. implement the Cloneable interface
  2. override the clone method with public access privileges
  3. call `super.clone()`
  4. Handle CloneNotSupported Exception

- shallow copies

  - By default, clone makes a *shallow copy* of all data fields in a class.
  - *Shallow copy* means that all data fields are copied in regular way. It doesn’t clone objects that are referenced inside other objects.

- Immutable Objects

  A special class of Objects are called *immutable* because their state cannot be changed once set. A common example is String.

- Deep copies

  - For *deep copies* that recurse through the objects, you have to do some more work.
  - `super.clone()` is first called to clone the first level of data fields.
  - Returned cloned object’s object fields are then accessed one by one and clone method is called for each.

- Object does not support `clone()`

- `finalize()` Method

  - Called as final step when Object is no longer used, just before garbage collection
  - Since java has automatic garbage collection, finalize() does not need to be overridden to reclaim memory.
  - Can be used to reclaim other resources – close streams, database connections, threads.

- `final`关键词

  - You use the final keyword in a method declaration to indicate that the method cannot be overridden by subclasses. 不能被子类重写
  - Note that you can also declare an entire class final. A class that is declared final cannot be subclassed. This is particularly useful, for example, when creating an immutable class like the String class 可以将整个类设置为`final`

- Abstract Methods and Classes

  An *abstract class* is a class that is declared abstract—it may or may not include abstract methods. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, but they can be subclassed.

  不可以被实例化

  如果一个类中含有抽象方法，那么这个类必须被定义为抽象类

- 子类继承抽象类的时候需要实现其中的抽象方法，如果不实现，那么子类也需要被定义为抽象类

- 接口和抽象类的差别

  - with abstract classes, you can declare fields that are **not static** and **final**, and define **public**, **protected**, and **private** concrete methods.
  - but in interfaces, all fields are automatically public, **static**, and **final**, and all methods that you declare or define (as default methods) are **public**

- 当一个抽象类实现接口的时候
