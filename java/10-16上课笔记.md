java中的package并不是层次结构的

- 静态导入

  `import static java.lang.MATH.PI;`

- 接口

  > In the Java programming language, an *interface* is a reference type, similar to a class, that can contain *only* constants, method signatures, default methods, static methods, and nested types. Method bodies exist only for default methods and static methods. Interfaces cannot be instantiated—they can only be *implemented* by classes or *extended* by other interfaces. 

- 在接口中可以写静态方法和default方法，默认为public，不可以将作用域改为其他类型

- 静态方法和实例方法的覆盖问题

  The distinction between hiding a static method and overriding an instance method has important implications:

  – The version of the overridden instance method that gets invoked is the one in the subclass.

  – The version of the hidden static method that gets invoked depends on whether it is invoked from the superclass or the subclass.

- 动态绑定

  条件：

  1. 要有继承
  2. overriding
  3. assign a subclass object to a superclass Variable

  Automaticaly selecting the appropriate method at runtime is called dynamic binding.

  – **If the method is private, static, final, or a constructor, then the compiler knows exactly which method to call. This is called static binding**.

  – **Otherwise, the method to be called depends on the actual type of the implicit parameter, and dynamic binding must be used at runtime**.

  上述代码打印出来的结果为`private` 的`f()`这是因为f在superclass中是private的，子类无法继承
